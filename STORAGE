 note:::
* when you choose General-purpose v2 (GPv2) in storage account creation we create all 4 types of storage services in same storage account.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


class::9:::::::::::

HOW TO CREATE STORAGE ACCOUNT
--------------------------------
STEPS
*select the storage account service.
*fill the all nessesary fields.
*onece created then go to resource.
*in the left side choose data storage.


1) HOW CREATE BLOB STORAGE OR CONTAINER STORAGE::::
--------------------------------------------------------

There are **three types of blobs**, each with a specific purpose üëá

### üü¶ 1. **Block Blob**

* **Purpose:** Stores text or binary data (like documents, images, videos, backups).
* **Use Case:** Best for storing **large files** that are read or written sequentially.
* **Example:** Uploading media files, documents, or backups.
* **Special feature:** Data is stored in blocks; you can upload or modify blocks individually.

---

### üü© 2. **Append Blob**

* **Purpose:** Optimized for **append operations** (adding data to the end).
* **Use Case:** Ideal for **logging** or **data streaming** where data is continuously added.
* **Example:** Server logs, IoT data streams.
* **Special feature:** You can only **append** data, not modify or delete existing content.

---

### üü® 3. **Page Blob**

* **Purpose:** Stores random-access files (can read/write specific parts).
* **Use Case:** Used for **virtual hard disks (VHDs)** of Azure Virtual Machines.
* **Example:** OS disks, data disks for VMs.
* **Special feature:** Data is divided into 512-byte **pages**, allowing **fast read/write**.

STEPS::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

*first create storage accont,then click on the storage name,in the left side bar show DATA STORAGE dropdown button this shows which type of 
 storage service we choose,select one storage service exampale containers or blob storage,
*open the container storage new page , click add container,mention the name and click create,now create container or blob storage service,
 now this storage is private so can't access outside. when we try access the out side do this things,select my container,in the above shows change the access level,
select that ,its shows opptions select private to container but not select so first go the in left side select settings under configuration,click configuration,
its shows "Allow Blob anonymous" access enable this and save it, then come to "change access level" change permission private to container,now my stored data access in the public.
*then go to container or blob storage inside we see upload option then upload any photos or videos etc,then click on we uploaded document its show URL copy the URL,
and brows in google ,showed we whatever storing data.


WHAT IS END POINTS:::::::::::::
-------------------------
What is an Endpoint in Azure Storage account
*An endpoint is basically a URL (web address) through which you can access the storage account services over the internet or via private network.
 It‚Äôs like the entry point to use your Azure storage resources.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


HOW TO CREATE fileshar STORAGE::::::::::::
---------------------------------------------------------------
* go to storage account then go to left side choose data storage dropdown button then click on file shares.create fileshare.
*then open the you creted file shaer,click on connect its shows os names u choose any one u sutes,and click on show script,one script will be showing,
 copy the that scripts,login to vm machin, then paste the copied script,
* then check the file shaer is mounted or not
  ## mount | grep -q ".file.core.windows.net" && echo "‚úÖ Azure File Share is mounted" || echo "‚ùå Azure File Share is NOT mounted"
  ## df -h

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS DISK::::::::::::
------------------------------

*In Azure, a disk is a virtual hard drive attached to your VM.
*The OS disk holds the system files.
*A data disk is an extra disk you can attach for storing data.
*After attaching a data disk, you must format it and mount it to use it.
*To check if it‚Äôs mounted, use

                                                                                    LINUX VM
                                                                                -----------------

SSH into your Linux VM:

```bash
ssh <username>@<vm_public_ip>
```

---

### ü™ú Step 4: Find the New Disk

Run:

```bash
lsblk
```

You‚Äôll see something like:

```
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0   30G  0 disk
‚îú‚îÄsda1   8:1    0   29G  0 part /
sdb      8:16   0  128G  0 disk
```

üëâ `sdb` is your new disk.

---

### ü™ú Step 5: Partition and Format the Disk

If the disk is new (empty):

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
```

Inside fdisk:

```
n   (new partition)
p   (primary)
1   (partition number)
Enter (default start)
Enter (default end)
w   (write and exit)
```

Then format it:

```bash
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1
```

---

### ü™ú Step 6: Mount the Disk

Create a folder to mount it:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/datadisk
```

Mount it:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/datadisk
```

Check:

```bash
df -h
```

‚úÖ You should see `/mnt/datadisk` listed.

---

### ü™ú Step 7: Make Mount Permanent

Get the UUID:

```bash
sudo blkid /dev/sdb1
```

Add it to `/etc/fstab`:

```bash
UUID=<your-uuid> /mnt/datadisk ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2
```

Save, then test:

```bash
sudo mount -a
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Now Your Disk Is Ready to Use!**

You can store files in `/mnt/datadisk` just like any other folder.
