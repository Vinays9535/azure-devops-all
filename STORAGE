### 🌩️ **What is Cloud Storage?**

Cloud storage is a service that lets you **store data (like files, photos, and videos) on the internet** instead of your computer’s hard drive.
The data is saved on remote servers managed by companies like **Google, Microsoft, Amazon, or Dropbox.**

---

### 💡 **Key Features**

1. **Accessibility:** You can access your data from anywhere with internet.
2. **Scalability:** Easily increase or decrease storage as needed.
3. **Backup & Recovery:** Protects data from loss due to device failure.
4. **Security:** Data is encrypted and protected by the cloud provider.
5. **Collaboration:** Multiple people can work on the same files online.

### 🔐 **Types of Cloud Storage**

1. **Object Storage** → Stores unstructured data (e.g., images, videos) – *Example: AWS S3*
2. **File Storage** → Shared files with folders – *Example: Google Drive*
3. **Block Storage** → For virtual machines and databases – *Example: Azure Disk Storage*

---

### 📈 **Advantages**

* No need for physical hard drives
* Automatic backup
* Easy file sharing
* High reliability (99.9% uptime)
* Cost-effective (pay only for what you use)

---

### ⚠️ **Disadvantages**

* Requires internet connection
* Possible security or privacy risks

TYPES OF DATA
-----------------

### 1. 📊 **Structured Data → Stored in Azure Table Storage**

* Azure **Table Storage** is used to store **structured data** (rows & columns).
* Each record is stored as a **key–value pair**.
* **Example:** Customer details, employee records, product lists.
* 💡 Works like a **NoSQL database**.

---

### 2. 📁 **Unstructured Data → Stored in Azure Blob Storage**

* Azure **Blob Storage** is for **unstructured data** like images, videos, documents, and backups.
* “Blob” means **Binary Large Object**.
* **Example:** Store photos, videos, PDFs, logs, backups.
* 💡 Commonly used for **media storage, website content, and data backup**.

---

### 3. 🧩 **Semi-Structured Data → Stored in Azure Cosmos DB or Blob Storage**

* **Semi-structured data** has tags or keys (like JSON or XML).
* Can be stored in **Azure Cosmos DB** (for fast queries) or **Blob Storage** (for large files).
* **Example:** IoT sensor data, web logs, app telemetry.
* 💡 Flexible for storing data that doesn’t fit in tables.
