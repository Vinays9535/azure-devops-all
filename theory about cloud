WHAT IS CLOUD
----------------

*Cloud means using the internet to store data and run applications instead of keeping them only on your own computer.
*It’s like renting computers, storage, and software from companies (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
*You can access it anytime, anywhere using the internet.
*No need to buy and maintain big servers, the cloud provider manages everything.
👉 In short: Cloud = Computers, storage, and software available on the internet.

EXAMPLE

*Think about Google Drive or Gmail.
*You don’t keep your emails or files only on your laptop.
*They are stored in the cloud (Google’s servers).
*You can open them on any phone or computer anywhere in the world, just by logging in.
👉 Same way, companies use cloud services (like AWS, Azure, GCP) to store data, run apps, and manage servers without buying big machines.


WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING
-------------------------
*cloud computing is the delivery of computing services including servers,storage,database,networking,software,security over the cloud to offer faster innovation.

WHY CLOUD COMPUTING
--------------------
*No big setup cost → You don’t need to buy expensive servers.
*Pay as you use → Like electricity, you only pay for what you use.
*Access anywhere → You can use apps and data from any device with internet.
*Scalable → If you need more power or storage, you can get it in minutes.
*Safe & Reliable → Cloud companies take care of backups and security.
*Faster → You can quickly build and run applications without waiting for hardware.
*👉 In short: Cloud computing saves money, gives flexibility, and makes work faster and easier.


CLOUD COMPUTING DEPLOYMENT MODELS
-------------------------------------

1 Public Cloud:::
*Services are provided over the internet by cloud companies (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
*Anyone can use it by paying money.
*Example: Gmail, Google Drive, AWS EC2.
✅ Cheap, scalable, no maintenance.
❌ Less control.

2 Private Cloud:::
*Cloud is used by only one company.
*Hosted either in their own data center or by a vendor.
*Example: Banks or Government offices using cloud only for them.
✅ More security, more control.
❌ Expensive.

3 Hybrid Cloud:::
*A mix of public + private cloud.
*Company keeps sensitive data in private cloud and uses public cloud for normal tasks.
*Example: A hospital stores patient data in private cloud but uses public cloud for running apps.
✅ Balanced cost, flexibility, and security.

👉 In short:
*Public = Shared & Cheap
*Private = Secure & Expensive
*Hybrid = Mix of Both


DIFFRENT CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE MODELS
------------------------------------------

1 INFRASTRCTURE AS A SERVICE MODEL (IAAS):::

 in this service model application,data,runtime,middleware,o/s,this are all services managed by user.
 then vertualization,servers,storage,networking these are all services managed by vender

2 PLATFORM AS A SERVICE MODEL (PAAS):::

 in this service model only application,and data services managed by user.
 remaining services managed by vendor.

3 SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE MODEL (SAAS):::

 in this service model all services managed a vendor.
becuse this is most effective cloud computing service models in now a days.


CLOUD BENIFITS
-----------------

*Cost Saving – No need to buy expensive servers, pay only for what you use.
*Scalability – Increase or decrease resources (storage, computing power) anytime.
*Accessibility – Access your apps and data from anywhere with internet.
*Flexibility – Supports many tools, apps, and services as per need.
*Reliability – Cloud providers keep backup and disaster recovery ready.
*Security – Data centers have strong security and encryption.
*Speed – Quickly launch apps, websites, or servers in minutes.
*Automatic Updates – Cloud providers maintain and update the systems for you.
👉 In short: Cloud saves money, gives flexibility, and makes work faster, safer, and easier.


CLOUD CHARACTERSTICS
-------------------------

*On-demand self-service – You can get servers, storage, or apps whenever you need, without asking anyone.
*Broad network access – You can access cloud services from anywhere using the internet (laptop, mobile, tablet).
*Resource pooling – Cloud providers share their resources (servers, storage) among many users.
*Rapid elasticity (Scalability) – You can easily increase or decrease resources (CPU, memory, storage) as per need.
*Measured service (Pay as you go) – You only pay for what you actually use, like electricity or water.
*High availability & reliability – Cloud is designed to be available 24/7 with backups.
*Security – Data and applications are protected using encryption and access control.
👉 In short: Cloud is flexible, scalable, available anytime, anywhere, and you pay only for what you use.


Why is Cloud popular today?
* Because it reduces IT costs, provides flexibility, supports remote work, and allows businesses to grow faster.



🔹 Basic Azure Q&A
----------------------------

Q1. What is Microsoft Azure?
👉 Azure is Microsoft’s cloud computing platform that provides services like servers, storage, databases, networking, and AI through the internet.

Q2. What are the benefits of using Azure?
👉 Cost saving, scalability, global reach, high security, and pay-as-you-go model.

Q3. What are the types of cloud deployment models in Azure?
👉 Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud.

Q4. What are the main service models in Azure?
👉 IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), SaaS (Software as a Service).

🔹 Azure Services Q&A
--------------------------------

Q5. What is Azure Virtual Machine (VM)?
👉 A VM is a computer running in the cloud. You can install apps, OS, and use it like your own server.

Q6. What is Azure App Service?
👉 It’s a PaaS service to host web apps, mobile apps, and APIs without managing servers.

Q7. What is Azure Storage?
👉 A service to store files, databases, and backups. Types: Blob Storage, File Storage, Queue Storage, Table Storage.

Q8. What is Azure Virtual Network (VNet)?
👉 It allows your Azure resources (VMs, databases) to securely communicate with each other.

Q9. What is Azure Active Directory (AAD)?
👉 It’s an identity and access management service. It controls who can log in and what they can access.
