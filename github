ðŸ”¹ What is Git?
----------------------

Git is a tool (a version control system).

It helps you track changes in your code (like keeping a history of edits).

You can undo mistakes, work with different versions, and collaborate with others.

Think of it like a time machine for your code.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:
If you write a program today, and tomorrow you mess it up, Git lets you go back to the older version.


ðŸ”¹ What is GitHub?
-----------------------

GitHub is a website (a cloud platform).

It stores your Git repositories online.

It makes it easy to share code, collaborate with teams, and use Git on the internet.

It also has features like issues, pull requests, CI/CD, and project boards.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:
Git is like writing your notes in a notebook.
GitHub is like uploading that notebook online so your friends can read, edit, and add to it.


ðŸ”‘ Key Difference:
-----------------------

Git = Local tool (on your computer) for version control.

GitHub = Online platform that uses Git to share and collaborate.


âš¡ In short:
---------------

Git â†’ Version control system.

GitHub â†’ Hosting + collaboration platform for Git repositories.
