STORAGE REPLICATION TYPES:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
--------------------------------------------------------------

In **Azure Storage**, **replication** helps keep your data safe and available even if there is a failure in hardware or an entire data center.
There are **four main types of replication** in Azure Storage:

---
### 🟩 **1. LRS (Locally Redundant Storage)**

* **Copies:** 3 copies within a **single data center**.
* **Protection:** Protects against **hardware failure** in the same location.
* **Cheapest** option.
* ✅ Suitable for: non-critical data or backup copies.

---

### 🟨 **2. ZRS (Zone-Redundant Storage)**

* **Copies:** 3 copies across **different availability zones** in the **same region**.
* **Protection:** Protects from **data center or zone failures**.
* **High availability** within the region.
* ✅ Suitable for: production data needing higher availability.

---

### 🟦 **3. GRS (Geo-Redundant Storage)**

* **Copies:** 6 copies — 3 in **primary region** + 3 in a **secondary region** (hundreds of km away).
* **Protection:** Against **regional outages or disasters**.
* ❌ Secondary region is **not accessible** unless Microsoft initiates failover.
* ✅ Suitable for: disaster recovery.

---

### 🟪 **4. RA-GRS (Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage)**

* **Copies:** Same as GRS (6 copies).
* **Extra feature:** You can **read data** from the **secondary region** anytime.
* ✅ Suitable for: applications needing **read access** during primary region outage.

---

### 🧾 **Summary Table:**

| Replication Type | Copies | Region                       | Read from Secondary | Best For                         |
| ---------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| LRS              | 3      | Single data center           | ❌                   | Low-cost local durability        |
| ZRS              | 3      | Multiple zones in one region | ❌                   | High availability in same region |
| GRS              | 6      | Two regions                  | ❌                   | Disaster recovery                |
| RA-GRS           | 6      | Two regions                  | ✅                   | Read access during failover      |

---


�

---

### 💾 **RAM (Random Access Memory)**

* It is **temporary memory**.
* Used by the computer to **run programs fast**.
* Data is **lost when power is off**.

---

### 💿 **ROM (Read Only Memory)**

* It is **permanent memory**.
* Stores **boot or startup instructions**.
* Data **cannot be changed easily**.

---

### 🧠 **Hard Disk (HDD)**

* It is a **storage device** to **save data permanently**.
* Works with **spinning disks** (mechanical).
* **Slower** than SSD but **cheaper** and **more capacity**.

---

### ⚡ **SSD (Solid State Drive)**

* It is a **faster type of storage**.
* Uses **chips** instead of spinning disks.
* **Faster**, **quiet**, and **more reliable** than HDD.

---

---

### 🌐 **WHAT is Access Tier?**

Access tiers in Azure define **how frequently you access your data** and **how much you pay** for storing it.
They help you **save money** by choosing the right storage option based on **data usage**.

---

### 💡 **WHY use Access Tiers?**

* To **reduce storage cost**.
* To **store data efficiently** based on how often you use it.
* To **manage lifecycle** of data (hot → cool → archive).

---

### 🕒 **WHEN and WHICH tier to use:**

| Tier        | Used When                                              | Purpose                                           | Cost                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hot**     | You **access data frequently** (daily or hourly)       | For active data and applications                  | 💰 **Highest cost per month**, but **low read/write cost**                                 |
| **Cool**    | You **access data occasionally** (once in a few weeks) | For backup, test data, or infrequently used files | 💰 **Lower storage cost**, but **higher access cost**                                      |
| **Archive** | You **rarely access data** (once in months or years)   | For long-term storage, compliance, old backups    | 💰 **Very low storage cost**, but **very high access cost** and **retrieval time** is long |

---

### 🧾 **Example:**

* 🔥 **Hot Tier** → For website images or active user files.
* ❄️ **Cool Tier** → For monthly reports or old project files.
* 🧊 **Archive Tier** → For legal documents or old backups kept for years.

---

note:::; example
* one movie trailer was uploaded the storage this one by defult store in the hot tier means more peoples watching or watched the trailer in first couple of days,
 next some days this trailer was older now waching pepoles will be redused that time trailern will be move to hot to cool tier,
 after 6 mothes that same trailer waching only few peoples only that time trailer move to cool tier to archive tier.




⚙️ What is IOPS?
------------------------------
IOPS means Input/Output Operations Per Second.
It measures how fast a storage device (like SSD or disk) can read and write data.

💡 Why IOPS is Important
It shows performance of storage.
Higher IOPS = faster data access.
Important for databases, VMs, and applications that need quick response.

🕒 When to Use or Check IOPS
When you need high-speed storage (for example, running SQL Server, SAP, or virtual machines).
When you compare SSD vs HDD performance.
When you choose Azure Disk types (Standard HDD, Standard SSD, Premium SSD, Ultra Disk — each gives different IOPS).

HOW TO CREATE STORAGE ACCOUNT
--------------------------------
STEPS
*select the storage account service.
*fill the all nessesary fields.
*onece created then go to resource.
*in the left side choose data storage.


1) HOW CREATE BLOB STORAGE OR CONTAINER STORAGE::::
--------------------------------------------------------

There are **three types of blobs**, each with a specific purpose 👇

### 🟦 1. **Block Blob**

* **Purpose:** Stores text or binary data (like documents, images, videos, backups).
* **Use Case:** Best for storing **large files** that are read or written sequentially.
* **Example:** Uploading media files, documents, or backups.
* **Special feature:** Data is stored in blocks; you can upload or modify blocks individually.

---

### 🟩 2. **Append Blob**

* **Purpose:** Optimized for **append operations** (adding data to the end).
* **Use Case:** Ideal for **logging** or **data streaming** where data is continuously added.
* **Example:** Server logs, IoT data streams.
* **Special feature:** You can only **append** data, not modify or delete existing content.

---

### 🟨 3. **Page Blob**

* **Purpose:** Stores random-access files (can read/write specific parts).
* **Use Case:** Used for **virtual hard disks (VHDs)** of Azure Virtual Machines.
* **Example:** OS disks, data disks for VMs.
* **Special feature:** Data is divided into 512-byte **pages**, allowing **fast read/write**.

STEPS::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

*first create storage accont,then click on the storage name,in the left side bar show DATA STORAGE dropdown button this shows which type of 
 storage service we choose,select one storage service exampale containers or blob storage,
*open the container storage new page , click add container,mention the name and click create,now create container or blob storage service,
 now this storage is private so can't access outside. when we try access the out side do this things,select my container,in the above shows change the access level,
select that ,its shows opptions select private to container but not select so first go the in left side select settings under configuration,click configuration,
its shows "Allow Blob anonymous" access enable this and save it, then come to "change access level" change permission private to container,now my stored data access in the public.
*then go to container or blob storage inside we see upload option then upload any photos or videos etc,then click on we uploaded document its show URL copy the URL,
and brows in google ,showed we whatever storing data.


WHAT IS END POINTS:::::::::::::
-------------------------
What is an Endpoint in Azure Storage account
*An endpoint is basically a URL (web address) through which you can access the storage account services over the internet or via private network.
 It’s like the entry point to use your Azure storage resources.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


HOW TO CREATE fileshar STORAGE::::::::::::
---------------------------------------------------------------
* go to storage account then go to left side choose data storage dropdown button then click on file shares.create fileshare.
*then open the you creted file shaer,click on connect its shows os names u choose any one u sutes,and click on show script,one script will be showing,
 copy the that scripts,login to vm machin, then paste the copied script,
* then check the file shaer is mounted or not
  ## mount | grep -q ".file.core.windows.net" && echo "✅ Azure File Share is mounted" || echo "❌ Azure File Share is NOT mounted"
  ## df -h

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








WHAT IS DISK::::::::::::
------------------------------

*In Azure, a disk is a virtual hard drive attached to your VM.
*The OS disk holds the system files.
*A data disk is an extra disk you can attach for storing data.
*After attaching a data disk, you must format it and mount it to use it.
*To check if it’s mounted, use

                                                                                    LINUX VM
                                                                                -----------------
