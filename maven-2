                                                                                                          ---------


WHAT IS MAVEN?
-----------------

*Maven is a build automation and project management tool mainly used in Java projects.
*onece developer create the source code then move to remote repo but computer or servers can't understand source code understand only binaries (like 0,1 )soo maven using maven,
maven is compile the source code and produce artifact.

     what is artifact
     ---------------------

           *In Maven (or software in general), an artifact is simply the final output file of your project (like a JAR, WAR, or ZIP) that can be shared or reused.
              ðŸ‘‰ Example:
                         You write Java code.
                         Maven builds it.
                         The artifact is the packaged file (say, myapp-1.0.jar , war,ear,gip,exe,msi)
                                    So in simple words:
                                       Artifact = the finished product of your project build.




WHY WE NEED TO BUILD TOOLS
-----------------------------

*We need build tools because they automate repetitive work in software development.
*Without them â†’ you must manually compile, collect libraries, run tests, and package everything.
*With them â†’ just run one command, and the tool does it all for you.

ðŸ‘‰ In simple words:
Build tools save time, avoid mistakes, and make building projects easy and consistent.


*build tool will healp us to transform your source code into binary / artifact
*It will also organise the source code , it will also generate the folder structure . it will manage build tools
*It will help us to create the documentation
*Build tools we can also integrate the tools ex like sonarqube,jenkins


WHY WE USED MAVEN
---------------------

*maven is developed by using java,and developping apache
*maven is a open source tool
*maven is populor build tool for java applicationes
*Dependency management â†’ Maven automatically downloads required libraries (JARs) from a central repository.
*Build automation â†’ One command can compile, test, package, and deploy your project.
*Standard project structure â†’ Maven enforces a common folder structure so all projects look the same.
*Reusability â†’ You can easily share your projectâ€™s artifact (JAR/WAR) with others.
*Integration â†’ Works well with CI/CD tools (Jenkins, SonarQube, etc.).
ðŸ‘‰ In simple words:
We use Maven to save time, avoid manual work, and keep projects consistent and easy to manage.



build tools for diffrent languages
---------------------------------------
*java : maven,graddle,ant
*nodejs : grunt
*.net : ms build
*python : python
*c,c++ : make
