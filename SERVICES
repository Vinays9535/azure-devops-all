✅ What is an Azure Resource Group?

A Resource Group is a container in Azure that holds related resources (like VMs, storage, networks, etc.).
It helps you organize, manage, and control access to those resources as a group.
All resources in a group should share the same lifecycle (created, updated, deleted together).


🛠️ How to Create a Resource Group (Simple Steps)
👉 Using Azure Portal:

Go to portal.azure.com
Search for “Resource groups”
Click “+ Create”
Select your Subscription
Enter a name for the Resource Group (e.g., myResourceGroup)
Choose a Region (e.g., East US)
Click “Review + Create”, then Create


how to create quick "vm"
--------------------------------

✅ Option 1: Create a Quick VM from Azure Portal (GUI - Easy)
🔹 Steps:

Go to https://portal.azure.com
Click "Create a resource" > "Virtual Machine"

Fill in the basics:

Subscription: Choose your subscription
Resource Group: Create new or use existing
VM Name: e.g., quickvm01
Region: e.g., East US
Image: Windows or Linux (e.g., Ubuntu LTS)
Size: e.g., Standard B1s (1 vCPU, 1GB RAM – free tier eligible)

Authentication:

Linux: SSH key or password
Windows: Username + password

Click "Review + Create"

Wait for validation → Click "Create"
✅ VM will be deployed in ~2–3 minutes.

                                                                           -----------------

WHAT IS NETWORKING
--------------------------
*connecting things or people to share resources, information, or support. 


What is Networking in Azure?
-------------------------------
*In Microsoft Azure, networking refers to the set of tools, services, and configurations that allow resources (like virtual machines, databases, apps) 
 to communicate with each other, with the internet, and with on-premises environments — securely and efficiently.


🌐 What is an IP Address?
-----------------------------

📌 Simple Definition:
    *An IP address is a numerical label that identifies a device on a network and allows it to communicate with other devices.

🧠 Why IP Addresses Matter:
    *They help route data to the correct destination.
    *Without them, devices couldn’t talk to each other over the internet or a local network.

✅ IP Address Example:
    192.168.1.10

📂 Types of IP Addresses
    1. IPv4 (Most common)
       Format: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (four numbers separated by dots)
       Example: 192.168.1.1
       Has about 4.3 billion possible addresses.

    2. IPv6 (Newer, larger)
       Format: Eight groups of hexadecimal numbers
       Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
       Supports trillions of devices (needed as the internet grows).

🔄 Two Main Categories of IP Addresses
    Type	Description	Example
   *Private IP	Used inside local networks (home, office). Not visible on the internet.	192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x
   *Public IP	Used to identify devices on the internet.	Assigned by your ISP.

🖥️ Static vs Dynamic IP
    Type	Description
   *Static IP	Fixed and doesn’t change. Useful for servers.
   *Dynamic IP	Changes over time. Assigned by your internet provider or DHCP.



IP ADRESS CLASS
-----------------

                                     RANGE                      
class A --------- N,H,H,H         
subnet mask------255,0,0,0          0 TO 126


class B --------- N,N,H,H                                      ( N means network ,H means host )
subnet mask------255,255,0,0        128 TO 191                   1 bit = 8 bites


class C --------- N,N,N,H         
subnet mask------255,255,255,0      192 TO 223


NETWORK = its a collection of ip adress
ADRESS =  its a range of ip adress

example : karnataka is network under the karnataka all districts is adress

* ip adress is a 32 bit max becuse every coloum has 8 bits
ex   8,8,8,8


🔐 2. Private IP Address Ranges (RFC 1918)
----------------------------------------------

These are not routable on the internet — used inside home and corporate networks.

Class	            Private IP Range	                 Subnet Mask
 A           10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 	            255.0.0.0 (/8)
 B	         172.16.0.0 –  172.31.255.255	         255.240.0.0 (/12)
 C	         192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255	       255.255.0.0 (/16)


HOW TO CALCULATE IP'S
--------------------------

EXAMPLE 1
i have one requirment i need 256 ip's

10.10.20.0/24

formula
32-24=8  2*n  2*8=2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2=256 ip's

 10.10.20.1
 10.10.20.2
 10.10.20.3
 |
 |
 |
 10.10.20.255


EXAMPLE 2
i have one requirment i need 512 ip's

172.16.0.0/23

32-23=9 2*9=512

172.16.0.0
172.16.0.1
172.16.0.2
172.16.0.3
|
|
|172.16.0.255

172.16.1.0
172.16.1.1
172.16.1.2
172.16.1.3
|
|
|
172.16.1.255

EXAMPLE 3
i have one requirment i need 512 ip's with 3 subnets

172.16.0.0/23
total number of ip's is 512

subnet1 : 256
subnet2 : 128
subnet3 : 128

*web subnet1 : 256 ips

172.16.0.0
172.16.0.1
172.16.0.3
|
|
|
172.16.0.255
172.16.1.0

*appsubnet2 : 128

172.16.1.1
172.16.1.2
172.16.1.3
|
|
|
172.16.1.128


*databasesubnet3 : 128

172.16.1.129
172.16.1.130
172.16.1.131
|
|
|
172.16.1.255
172.16.2.0
172.16.2.1


NOTE:
172.16.0.0/23    networking address
172.16.0.0        ip address



📘 What is CIDR?
-------------------------
CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing.
It is a method used to allocate IP addresses and manage IP networks more efficiently than the old class-based system (Class A, B, C).

🔹 Simple Definition:
CIDR is a way to represent IP addresses and their associated network size using a slash ( / ) and a number.
This is called CIDR notation.

✅ Example of CIDR Notation:
192.168.1.0/24
192.168.1.0 → Network address
/24 → Subnet mask (means the first 24 bits are the network part)

🧠 Why CIDR Is Important:
Before CIDR, IPs were divided into fixed-size classes (A, B, C), which often wasted IPs.
CIDR allows:
Flexible allocation of IP addresses
Efficient use of IPv4 space
Better routing aggregation


📏 CIDR and Subnet Masks

CIDR notation replaces the older subnet mask format.
Here are some common examples:

CIDR	       Subnet Mask	      # of IPs	    Description
/8	         255.0.0.0	       16,777,216  	Very large networks
/16	         255.255.0.0	       65,536	      Large network
/24	         255.255.255.0	      256	        Common for LANs
/30	         255.255.255.252	     4	      Point-to-point links
/32	         255.255.255.255	     1	      Single IP (host only)

Note: Of the total IPs in a subnet, 2 are reserved: one for the network address, and one for the broadcast address.




🏗️ What is 3-Tier Architecture?
---------------------------------------
3-tier architecture is a software design model that separates an application into three logical layers, each with its own responsibility.
It’s commonly used in web applications and cloud environments (like Azure or AWS) to improve scalability, maintainability, and security.


🔍 The 3 Tiers Explained

| Tier                     | Also Called                  | Purpose                                  | Example                       |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **1. Presentation Tier** | UI / Front-end               | Handles user interface and interactions  | Web browser, mobile app       |
| **2. Application Tier**  | Business Logic / Middle-tier | Processes data, contains the app’s logic | API, web server, backend code |
| **3. Data Tier**         | Database Layer               | Stores and retrieves data                | SQL Server, MySQL, MongoDB    |




🌐 Azure Virtual Network (VNet) – Key Information
✅ What is Azure Virtual Network (VNet)?
----------------------------------------------------------

Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a private, isolated network in Azure where you can run your Azure resources (like virtual machines, databases, and apps) 
securely — just like you would in your own on-premises data center.
It’s like creating your own private network in the cloud.

🎯 Why Use VNet?
-------
*Secure communication between Azure resources
*Connect to on-premises networks
*Control traffic with subnets, firewalls, NSGs
*Enable hybrid cloud scenarios
*Host internet-facing and internal apps


NOTE:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
* the physical area of the data center is cold region.
* the physical data center is convert to vertulization is cold zone.
* its a verulized data centtre is cold zone
*region will represents VNET
*VNET are region specific
*zones will represents subnets
*in one data center create a multiple subnets
*in one subnet can't share maltiple data center
