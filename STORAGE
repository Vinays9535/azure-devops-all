### üå©Ô∏è **What is Cloud Storage?**

Cloud storage is a service that lets you **store data (like files, photos, and videos) on the internet** instead of your computer‚Äôs hard drive.
The data is saved on remote servers managed by companies like **Google, Microsoft, Amazon, or Dropbox.**

---

### üí° **Key Features**

1. **Accessibility:** You can access your data from anywhere with internet.
2. **Scalability:** Easily increase or decrease storage as needed.
3. **Backup & Recovery:** Protects data from loss due to device failure.
4. **Security:** Data is encrypted and protected by the cloud provider.
5. **Collaboration:** Multiple people can work on the same files online.

### üîê **Types of Cloud Storage**

1. **Object Storage** ‚Üí Stores unstructured data (e.g., images, videos) ‚Äì *Example: AWS S3*
2. **File Storage** ‚Üí Shared files with folders ‚Äì *Example: Google Drive*
3. **Block Storage** ‚Üí For virtual machines and databases ‚Äì *Example: Azure Disk Storage*

---

### üìà **Advantages**

* No need for physical hard drives
* Automatic backup
* Easy file sharing
* High reliability (99.9% uptime)
* Cost-effective (pay only for what you use)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disadvantages**

* Requires internet connection
* Possible security or privacy risks
* Ongoing subscription cost

AZURE STORAGE ACCOUNT
--------------------------
*Azure Storage Account is a place to store your data in Microsoft Azure cloud.
*It lets you save files, images, videos, and backups safely online.
*You can access your data anytime, from anywhere using the internet.
*It supports different storage types like Blobs, Files, Queues, Tables, and Disks.
*It is secure, scalable, and reliable for both small and large data.
*You pay only for what you use (consumption-based model).
*Azure automatically manages backup, availability, and replication.

NOTE::::
*for one subscription we can create up to 300 storage accounts.
*each storage account has the capacity to store up to 500TB of data.
*the name of the storage account should be unique,you have to use only small letters.
* azure storage account is a region specific.


TYPES OF DATA
-----------------

### 1. üìä **Structured Data ‚Üí Stored in Azure Table Storage**

* Azure **Table Storage** is used to store **structured data** (rows & columns).
* Each record is stored as a **key‚Äìvalue pair**.
* **Example:** Customer details, employee records, product lists.
* üí° Works like a **NoSQL database**.

---

### 2. üìÅ **Unstructured Data ‚Üí Stored in Azure Blob Storage**

* Azure **Blob Storage** is for **unstructured data** like images, videos, documents, and backups.
* ‚ÄúBlob‚Äù means **Binary Large Object**.
* **Example:** Store photos, videos, PDFs, logs, backups.
* üí° Commonly used for **media storage, website content, and data backup**.

---

### 3. üß© **Semi-Structured Data ‚Üí Stored in Azure Cosmos DB or Blob Storage**

* **Semi-structured data** has tags or keys (like JSON or XML).
* Can be stored in **Azure Cosmos DB** (for fast queries) or **Blob Storage** (for large files).
* **Example:** IoT sensor data, web logs, app telemetry.
* üí° Flexible for storing data that doesn‚Äôt fit in tables.

### üí° **Main Azure Storage Services**
---------------------------------------------

1. **üü¶ Blob Storage or container storage (Binary Large Object):**

   * Used to store **unstructured data** like images, videos, backups, and documents.
   * Example: Store app logs, website files, or photos.

2. **üìÅ File Storage:**

   * Used to create **shared file systems** in the cloud.
   * Works like a **network file share (like shared folders in Windows)**.
   * Example: Used by teams to share files across virtual machines.

3. **üì¶ Queue Storage:**

   * Used to **store and manage messages** between applications.
   * Helps apps **communicate asynchronously** (send & receive messages).
   * Example: Background job processing, order processing systems.

4. **üìä Table Storage:**

   * Used to store **structured NoSQL data** (key-value pairs).
   * Example: Store user details, product info, or IoT data.

5. **üíΩ Disk Storage:**

   * Provides **virtual hard disks (VHDs)** for Azure Virtual Machines.
   * Example: Used to store operating systems or app data for VMs.

 note:::
* when you choose General-purpose v2 (GPv2) in storage account creation we create all 4 types of storage services in same storage account.



class::9:::::::::::

HOW TO CREATE STORAGE ACCOUNT
--------------------------------
STEPS
*select the storage account service.
*fill the all nessesary fields.
*onece created then go to resource.
*in the left side choose data storage.


1) HOW CREATE BLOB STORAGE OR CONTAINER STORAGE::::
--------------------------------------------------------

There are **three types of blobs**, each with a specific purpose üëá

### üü¶ 1. **Block Blob**

* **Purpose:** Stores text or binary data (like documents, images, videos, backups).
* **Use Case:** Best for storing **large files** that are read or written sequentially.
* **Example:** Uploading media files, documents, or backups.
* **Special feature:** Data is stored in blocks; you can upload or modify blocks individually.

---

### üü© 2. **Append Blob**

* **Purpose:** Optimized for **append operations** (adding data to the end).
* **Use Case:** Ideal for **logging** or **data streaming** where data is continuously added.
* **Example:** Server logs, IoT data streams.
* **Special feature:** You can only **append** data, not modify or delete existing content.

---

### üü® 3. **Page Blob**

* **Purpose:** Stores random-access files (can read/write specific parts).
* **Use Case:** Used for **virtual hard disks (VHDs)** of Azure Virtual Machines.
* **Example:** OS disks, data disks for VMs.
* **Special feature:** Data is divided into 512-byte **pages**, allowing **fast read/write**.

STEPS

*first create storage accont,then click on the storage name,in the left side bar show DATA STORAGE dropdown button this shows which type of 
 storage service we choose,select one storage service exampale containers or blob storage,
*open the container storage new page , click add container,mention the name and click create,now create container or blob storage service,
 now this storage is private so can't access outside. when we try access the out side do this things,select my container,in the above shows change the access level,
select that ,its shows opptions select private to container but not select so first go the in left side select settings under configuration,click configuration,
its shows "Allow Blob anonymous" access enable this and save it, then come to "change access level" change permission private to container,now my stored data access in the public.
*then go to container or blob storage inside we see upload option then upload any photos or videos etc,then click on we uploaded document its show URL copy the URL,
and brows in google ,showed we whatever storing data.
