‚úÖ What is an Azure Resource Group?

A Resource Group is a container in Azure that holds related resources (like VMs, storage, networks, etc.).
It helps you organize, manage, and control access to those resources as a group.
All resources in a group should share the same lifecycle (created, updated, deleted together).


üõ†Ô∏è How to Create a Resource Group (Simple Steps)
üëâ Using Azure Portal:

Go to portal.azure.com
Search for ‚ÄúResource groups‚Äù
Click ‚Äú+ Create‚Äù
Select your Subscription
Enter a name for the Resource Group (e.g., myResourceGroup)
Choose a Region (e.g., East US)
Click ‚ÄúReview + Create‚Äù, then Create


how to create quick "vm"
--------------------------------

‚úÖ Option 1: Create a Quick VM from Azure Portal (GUI - Easy)
üîπ Steps:

                                                                           -----------------

WHAT IS NETWORKING IN GENARAL?
--------------------------
*connecting things or people to share resources, information, or support. 


What is Networking in Azure?
-------------------------------
*A network is a collection of interconnected devices (hosts,routers,switches)that exchange data using specific protocols (like TCP/IP).
it can be local area network(LAN),wide area network((WAN),or other configurations.



WHAT IS THE INTERNET?
--------------------------
* Thes internet is a global network of networks that uses the TCP/IP protocol suite to link devices worldwide.


üåê What is an IP Address?
-----------------------------

üìå Simple Definition:
    *An IP address is a numerical label that identifies a device on a network and allows it to communicate with other devices.

üß† Why IP Addresses Matter:
    *They help route data to the correct destination.
    *Without them, devices couldn‚Äôt talk to each other over the internet or a local network.

‚úÖ IP Address Example:
    192.168.1.10

üìÇ Types of IP Addresses

    1. what is IPv4:::::: 
*IPv4 means Internet Protocol version 4.
*It is the main system used to identify devices on a network using unique addresses.
*An IPv4 address looks like this: 192.168.1.1.
*It uses 32 bits, so there are about 4 billion unique addresses.
*IPv4 helps computers find and talk to each other over the internet or local network.


    2. üåê What is IPv6:::::
*IPv6 means Internet Protocol version 6.
*It is the new version of IP address used to identify devices on the internet.
*It was created because IPv4 addresses (like 192.168.1.1) are running out.
*IPv6 looks like this: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
*It gives a huge number of unique addresses (almost unlimited).
*It also supports better security, faster routing, and auto-configuration.


üîÑ Two Main Categories of IP Addresses
    Type	Description	Example
   *Private IP	Used inside local networks (home, office). Not visible on the internet.	192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x
   *Public IP	Used to identify devices on the internet.	Assigned by your ISP.

üñ•Ô∏è Static vs Dynamic IP
    Type	Description
   *Static IP	Fixed and doesn‚Äôt change. Useful for servers.
   *Dynamic IP	Changes over time. Assigned by your internet provider or DHCP.



IP ADRESS CLASS
-----------------

                                     RANGE                      
class A --------- N,H,H,H         
subnet mask------255,0,0,0          0 TO 126


class B --------- N,N,H,H                                      ( N means network ,H means host )
subnet mask------255,255,0,0        128 TO 191                   1 bit = 8 bites


class C --------- N,N,N,H         
subnet mask------255,255,255,0      192 TO 223


NETWORK = its a collection of ip adress
ADRESS =  its a range of ip adress

example : karnataka is network under the karnataka all districts is adress

* ip adress is a 32 bit max becuse every coloum has 8 bits
ex   8,8,8,8


üîê 2. Private IP Address Ranges (RFC 1918)
----------------------------------------------

These are not routable on the internet ‚Äî used inside home and corporate networks.

Class	            Private IP Range	                 Subnet Mask
 A           10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255 	            255.0.0.0 (/8)
 B	         172.16.0.0 ‚Äì  172.31.255.255	         255.240.0.0 (/12)
 C	         192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255	       255.255.0.0 (/16)


HOW TO CALCULATE IP'S
--------------------------

EXAMPLE 1
i have one requirment i need 256 ip's

10.10.20.0/24

formula
32-24=8  2*n  2*8=2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2=256 ip's

 10.10.20.1
 10.10.20.2
 10.10.20.3
 |
 |
 |
 10.10.20.255


EXAMPLE 2
i have one requirment i need 512 ip's

172.16.0.0/23

32-23=9 2*9=512

172.16.0.0
172.16.0.1
172.16.0.2
172.16.0.3
|
|
|172.16.0.255

172.16.1.0
172.16.1.1
172.16.1.2
172.16.1.3
|
|
|
172.16.1.255

EXAMPLE 3
i have one requirment i need 512 ip's with 3 subnets

172.16.0.0/23
total number of ip's is 512

subnet1 : 256
subnet2 : 128
subnet3 : 128

*web subnet1 : 256 ips

172.16.0.0
172.16.0.1
172.16.0.3
|
|
|
172.16.0.255
172.16.1.0

*appsubnet2 : 128

172.16.1.1
172.16.1.2
172.16.1.3
|
|
|
172.16.1.128


*databasesubnet3 : 128

172.16.1.129
172.16.1.130
172.16.1.131
|
|
|
172.16.1.255
172.16.2.0
172.16.2.1


NOTE:
172.16.0.0/23    networking address
172.16.0.0        ip address



üìò What is CIDR?
-------------------------
CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing.
It is a method used to allocate IP addresses and manage IP networks more efficiently than the old class-based system (Class A, B, C).

üîπ Simple Definition:
CIDR is a way to represent IP addresses and their associated network size using a slash ( / ) and a number.
This is called CIDR notation.

‚úÖ Example of CIDR Notation:
192.168.1.0/24
192.168.1.0 ‚Üí Network address
/24 ‚Üí Subnet mask (means the first 24 bits are the network part)

üß† Why CIDR Is Important:
Before CIDR, IPs were divided into fixed-size classes (A, B, C), which often wasted IPs.
CIDR allows:
Flexible allocation of IP addresses
Efficient use of IPv4 space
Better routing aggregation


üìè CIDR and Subnet Masks

CIDR notation replaces the older subnet mask format.
Here are some common examples:

CIDR	       Subnet Mask	      # of IPs	    Description
/8	         255.0.0.0	       16,777,216  	Very large networks
/16	         255.255.0.0	       65,536	      Large network
/24	         255.255.255.0	      256	        Common for LANs
/30	         255.255.255.252	     4	      Point-to-point links
/32	         255.255.255.255	     1	      Single IP (host only)

Note: Of the total IPs in a subnet, 2 are reserved: one for the network address, and one for the broadcast address.




üèóÔ∏è What is 3-Tier Architecture?
---------------------------------------
3-tier architecture is a software design model that separates an application into three logical layers, each with its own responsibility.
It‚Äôs commonly used in web applications and cloud environments (like Azure or AWS) to improve scalability, maintainability, and security.


üîç The 3 Tiers Explained

| Tier                     | Also Called                  | Purpose                                  | Example                       |

| **2. Application Tier**  | Business Logic / Middle-tier | Processes data, contains the app‚Äôs logic | API, web server, backend code |
| **3. Data Tier**         | Database Layer               | Stores and retrieves data                | SQL Server, MySQL, MongoDB    |



WHAT ARE PORTS?
----------------
* ports are logical access points through which data enters or leaves a device on a network.each port is associated with a specific protocol or service.

| **Port**        | **Protocol**   | **Purpose**                                                |

| **5000 / 5001** | Custom APIs    | Commonly used for REST APIs and apps                       |



WHAT IS INBOUND AND OUTBOUND TRAFFIC?
--------------------------------------------
* inbound trafic refers to incoming data packets in to network,typically from external sources like the internet.
* outbound trafic is the data packets sent from within a network to external destinations.


WHAT IS A SERVER,AND WHAT IS A CLIENT?
-----------------------------------------
* A sever is a system that provides resources, or data to other machines.
* A client is a system or software that requests srvices or resources from a server,
  common examples (providing web pages)and email servers.



üåê Azure Virtual Network (VNet) ‚Äì Key Information
‚úÖ What is Azure Virtual Network (VNet)?
----------------------------------------------------------

Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a private, isolated network in Azure where you can run your Azure resources (like virtual machines, databases, and apps) 
securely ‚Äî just like you would in your own on-premises data center.
It‚Äôs like creating your own private network in the cloud.

üéØ Why Use VNet?
-------
*Secure communication between Azure resources
*Connect to on-premises networks
*Control traffic with subnets, firewalls, NSGs
*Enable hybrid cloud scenarios
*Host internet-facing and internal apps


WHAT IS SUBNET?
------------------
*A subnet means sub-network ‚Äî a small part of a larger network.
*It helps divide a big network into smaller, easier-to-manage parts.
*Each subnet has its own range of IP addresses.
*It improves security and network performance.
üß† Example:
*If your company has a big network, you can create one subnet for HR, one for IT, and one for Sales ‚Äî all still connected but separated for better control.


NOTE:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
* the physical area of the data center is cold region.
* the physical data center is convert to vertulization is cold zone.
* its a verulized data centtre is cold zone
*region will represents VNET
*VNET are region specific
*zones will represents subnets
*in one data center create a multiple subnets
*in one subnet can't share maltiple data center


class::5

TASK:1
----------

*under the subscription create resouce group(RG),then under the RG create one vnet, then under the vnet create 2 subnets (sub1,sub2),
* create the 2 VM each 2 subnets,then login the 1 VM using public ip example (ssh -i ~/Downloads/vm-keypair.pem azureuser@74.225.190.74)
*onece login the 1 VM check the comunication b/w the another VM using (ping praivate ip).

NOTE::
* by the default VM's which are part of same network they will comunicate with each other 
(even though they are part of two diffrent subnet's) 


TASK:2
--------

HYBRID CONNECTIVITY OPTIONES
------------------------------

- If you have a two different networks , by default they wil not communicate with each other,
  so how to enable the connectivity
- From on prem Data center to Azure vnet how to set up the connectivity
- From specific location or point how to enable the communication

*Steps to enable the communication b/w two vnets

- Create two vnets in the same region with subnets
- Deploy vm‚Äôs
- Check the connectivity b/w vm‚Äôs
- And the Enable Vnet Peering - if the vnet‚Äôs are part of same region.

                         *then try
- Global Regions - if the vnet‚Äôs are part of different regions,we need to enable global vnet peering.

NOTE:::::
* in the same region peering vnets i cold vnet peearing.
* in the diffrent region peering vnets is cold global vnet peearing.
* establish the connectivity , communication  b/w two diffrent vnet using microsft network.



CLASS::6

POINT TO SITE CONNECTION
----------------------------
------------------------------

USE CASE:::

*when i am doing work from home or certain or specific location,connect to wifi,wifi is public network and i connected vm's using public network,
 vm's is only having private ip in real time,can we dont able to connect or access the vm's.
*it can be only work or access inside the specific network
*now how we are going to achive, now i am work from home, i want to access vm's from my office laptop.
* we can achive through point to site connection.
*from specific location such as when you are working from home to access private ip we need point to site connection.

HOW WE CONFIGURE P2S CONNECTION::::::::

STEAPS::::::

* create vnet with one subnet
* create gateway subnet
* create vpn gateway
* generate root and chaild certificates
* upload the root certificate data into vpn gateway
* install chaild certificate into your pc
* download the vpn client
* connect to the vpn client

note: SKU  it represents size of the resource


1) create vnet with one subnet:::::

* create virtual network
* create one subnet  this is application subnet, purpose  default means application subnet
* cerate one additional subnet   name it self , purpose   virtual network gateway
* review and create

2) create vpn gateway:::::::::

* search virtual network gateways  service
* search left bar vpn gateways---click---create
* name,gateway type(vpn gateway),sku(vpngw1),select vnet,public ip address name(create new),enable active active mode(disable),
 configure BGP(disable),enable key vault access(disable)then review and create.
* it can take around 20 min for create, becuse all operationes take care by azure.

3) generate root and chaild certificates:::::::

 * go to browse  "  Configure server settings for P2S VPN Gateway certificate authentication "
 * scroll down
 * under the  generate a root certificate  click powershell instructiones for windows 10  
 * shows this command

    $params = @{
    Type = 'Custom'
    Subject = 'CN=P2SRootCert'
    KeySpec = 'Signature'
    KeyExportPolicy = 'Exportable'
    KeyUsage = 'CertSign'
    KeyUsageProperty = 'Sign'
    KeyLength = 2048
    HashAlgorithm = 'sha256'
    NotAfter = (Get-Date).AddMonths(24)
    CertStoreLocation = 'Cert:\CurrentUser\My'
}
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate @params

* copy the this command then go to the command prompt set cli to windows power shell paste enter

* under the  generate a chaild or claient certificate  click powershell instructiones for windows 10  
* shows this command

    $params = @{
       Type = 'Custom'
       Subject = 'CN=P2SChildCert'
       DnsName = 'P2SChildCert'

       KeyExportPolicy = 'Exportable'
       KeyLength = 2048
       HashAlgorithm = 'sha256'
       NotAfter = (Get-Date).AddMonths(18)
       CertStoreLocation = 'Cert:\CurrentUser\My'
       Signer = $cert
       TextExtension = @(
        '2.5.29.37={text}1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2')
   }
   New-SelfSignedCertificate @params

* copy the this command then go to the command prompt set cli to windows power shell paste enter
* mmc  ---- type in the cli enter
* go to click on the file,add remove snap in,then click on the certificates,add,choose--my user account,click--finish,click--ok

THEN-

* certificate-current user--click the drop down button,click the personal drop down button,click on the certificates,
now show the root and chaild or client certificate. now use this but can't be directly soo export this
* right click on the root certificate--go to all tasks,click on export,next,choose no,do not export the private key,next,
 select encription type--base-64--next.

THEN--

* we can brows where you want to choose,choose desktop--file name rootcert--save--ok.
now we will export the client or chaild certificate,
* select claient or chailed certifiate right click--all tasks--export--next--choose yes,export the private key--next--create the password--
 next--create the password--next--choose the desktop--filename clientcert--save--finish--ok.

( NOW WE CREATE THE CERTIFICATE )



4) upload the root certificate data into vpn gateway::::::

* we go to vpn gateway--in the left bar select point to site configuration--click on configure now--
 select authentication--select azure certificate--when i choose azure certificate ask u details--they ask public certificate data.
soo go to desk top--open the rootcert in notepad---copy without begin and end bars---paste the copied certificate in the public certificate 
data place--mention the name rootcert,choose tunnel type---1kev2 and open vpn(ssl),in adresspool---provide ip address 10.50.0.0/24,then save it.
*onece save then show download vpn client take 1 or 2 min for update this the download that,then download.

** meanwile we create one vm without public ip-create-public ip name-review and create.

*** onece download the vpn clinent,it's shows the zip file formate,let that extract.
    HOW
    * right click on the zip file--select extract all--extract.
      open the extract file,it download the multiple files---click on windowsx64  doubble click on this file--run any way-yes-ok,then see vpn get install.


  ** before we connect to this we need to install chaild or client certificate
     HOW
     * go to home page--select clientcertificate or chaild certificate--rightclick--install pfx--choose current user--next--
       this is ask password---mention--next--finish---ok.


   ** now we can go vpn icon--click on connect.
     ** before the connect one more thing do---login to vm with private ip,copy the private ip--go to cli
        *( ssh azureadmin@ip adress )
        * ip config     ---- this command shows current setup.

** comeback to vpn connect--click on connect--connect--continue--the status will show connected.



NOTE:::::::::::
               this is azure provided one,other vpn's or firewall also there in market example:: poloalto,global protect vpn  etc..




SITE TO SITE CONNECTION (S2S)::::
-----------------------------------

üåê What is an S2S (Site-to-Site) VPN in Azure?

*It‚Äôs a secure tunnel (IPsec/IKE) that connects your on-premises network or another VNet to your Azure virtual network (VNet).
*It uses the public internet but encrypts traffic end-to-end.
*You configure it using a VPN Gateway on Azure and a VPN device (firewall/router) or another Azure gateway on the other side.

#WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF VPN GATEWAY IN AZURE::::::
-----------------------------------------------------
*VPN Gateway in Azure is used to securely connect your Azure network (VNet) to another network ‚Äî like your on-premises network or another VNet.
*It sends data through an encrypted tunnel over the Internet.
*It helps in site-to-site, point-to-site, or VNet-to-VNet connections.
*Simply: it acts like a secure bridge between Azure and other networks.


#WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE LOCAL NETWORK GATEWAY IN AZURE::::::::::
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Local Network Gateway in Azure is used to represent your on-premises network (your office or home network) in Azure.

     It stores details like:
*Your public IP address of the VPN device (router/firewall).
*The address ranges (subnets) of your on-premises network.
üëâ It helps Azure know where to send traffic when you create a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN connection between your on-premises network and Azure Virtual Network.


#WHAT IS THE PUPOSE OF THE VPN CONNECTION IN AZURE:::::::::::::::
-------------------------------------------------------------------
*A VPN connection in Azure is used to securely connect your on-premises network (your local office or data center)
to your Azure virtual network (VNet) over the internet.
üëâ Purpose:
*To create a secure tunnel between your local network and Azure.
*To access Azure resources privately and safely.
*To extend your data center into the Azure cloud.
*To connect multiple VNets across regions or subscriptions securely.
Example:
*Your company office network ‚ÜîÔ∏è Azure network (through VPN) = Safe data transfer.


HOW TO SET UP site to site (S2S) CONNECTION:::::::::
STEPS::::::::::::
---------------------------------

*create two venet one is azure vnet other one is onprime vnet and create 2 subnets one is application subnet other one is gateway subnet.
*creat 2 vpn gateway one for azure vnet other one for onprime vnet.
*create 2 local network gateway one for azure other one for onprime.
* ceate 2 vpn connectiones.
* create 2 vm's for testing purpose using ping command.



üåê What is Active-Active Mode in S2S VPN:::::::::::
-------------------------------------------
In Active-Active mode, both VPN gateways (on each site) have two active tunnels running at the same time.
So instead of one tunnel being active and the other being backup (like in Active-Passive), both tunnels carry traffic simultaneously.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Points to Know
*Feature	Description
*High Availability	If one tunnel or gateway goes down, traffic automatically continues through the other tunnel ‚Äî no downtime.
*Load Balancing	Both tunnels can share network traffic, improving speed and reliability.
*Dual IPs	Each VPN gateway in Azure gets two public IPs (active-active). Your on-premises VPN device must also support two IPs.
*Dynamic Routing	Uses BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) to automatically manage routes between both gateways.
*Resiliency	Helps protect against network or hardware failure on either side.
*Performance	Can give better throughput compared to a single tunnel setup.

üß© When to Use Active-Active Mode
‚úÖ Recommended when:
*You need high availability and no downtime in your VPN connection.
*You have critical workloads that can‚Äôt afford interruptions.
*Your on-premises VPN device supports two simultaneous tunnels and BGP.
üö´ Not needed when:
*You have a simple setup or low-cost lab/test environment.
*Your on-premises device doesn‚Äôt support dual VPN tunnels.
üîê Example Setup

Azure side:::::::::::::::
*One Virtual Network Gateway (VPN type: Route-based).
*Two public IPs automatically assigned.
On-premises side:::::::::::::::
*VPN device configured with two local network gateways.
*Each local network gateway connects to one Azure public IP.
*BGP runs between both peers.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Requirements
*VPN type must be Route-based (not Policy-based).
*BGP is required for route exchange.
*Both VPN devices (Azure and on-prem) must support IKEv2 and Active-Active mode.
*Each connection must have a unique shared key (PSK) if not using certificates.

üß† In Simple Words
*‚ÄúActive-Active mode means both tunnels are active at once ‚Äî giving better speed, balance, and reliability. If one fails, the other keeps traffic running automatically.‚Äù



üåê What is ExpressRoute
----------------------------
*ExpressRoute is a private connection between your on-premises network (like your office or data center) and Azure cloud ‚Äî it does not use the public internet.

‚öôÔ∏è Why we use ExpressRoute
*To get a faster and more reliable connection to Azure.
*To have better security, since data doesn‚Äôt travel over the internet.
*To handle large amounts of data safely between your data center and Azure.
*To ensure low latency (less delay) for critical applications.
*To provide high availability and stable performance compared to VPN.

üí° In short:
*ExpressRoute = Private, high-speed, secure connection between your company network and Azure (not over the internet).


üåç What is an Edge Location in Azure
--------------------------------------------
*An Edge Location in Azure is a point of presence (PoP) ‚Äî a place close to users where data is cached or processed to make apps and content load faster.

‚öôÔ∏è Purpose
*To deliver content quickly (like videos, files, websites).
*To reduce latency (less delay) by serving users from the nearest location.
*Used mainly by Azure CDN, Front Door, and Traffic Manager services.

üí° In short:
*Edge Location = A nearby Azure site that helps deliver your data faster to users.



Here‚Äôs a simple comparison between ExpressRoute and Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN üëá
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


| Feature              | **ExpressRoute**                                                         | **Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN**                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Connection type**  | Private connection (not over internet)                                   | Uses public internet (secured with encryption)    |
| **Speed**            | Very high speed (up to 100 Gbps)                                         | Limited speed (depends on internet bandwidth)     |
| **Security**         | Highly secure ‚Äì private line                                             | Secure (data encrypted), but over public internet |
| **Reliability**      | More stable and consistent                                               | Can vary if internet is unstable                  |
| **Latency (delay)**  | Very low                                                                 | Higher (because of internet route)                |
| **Cost**             | Expensive (used by large companies)                                      | Cheaper (good for small/medium setups)            |
| **Use case**         | For mission-critical workloads, large data transfer, enterprise networks | For normal connectivity or testing environments   |
| **Setup complexity** | More complex (needs telecom provider)                                    | Easier to set up directly in Azure                |

üí° In short:
*ExpressRoute = Private, fast, secure, costly.
*S2S VPN = Internet-based, secure, slower, cheaper.
