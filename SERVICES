✅ What is an Azure Resource Group?

A Resource Group is a container in Azure that holds related resources (like VMs, storage, networks, etc.).
It helps you organize, manage, and control access to those resources as a group.
All resources in a group should share the same lifecycle (created, updated, deleted together).
