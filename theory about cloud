WHAT IS CLOUD
----------------

*Cloud means using the internet to store data and run applications instead of keeping them only on your own computer.
*It‚Äôs like renting computers, storage, and software from companies (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
*You can access it anytime, anywhere using the internet.
*No need to buy and maintain big servers, the cloud provider manages everything.
üëâ In short: Cloud = Computers, storage, and software available on the internet.

EXAMPLE

*Think about Google Drive or Gmail.
*You don‚Äôt keep your emails or files only on your laptop.
*They are stored in the cloud (Google‚Äôs servers).
*You can open them on any phone or computer anywhere in the world, just by logging in.
üëâ Same way, companies use cloud services (like AWS, Azure, GCP) to store data, run apps, and manage servers without buying big machines.


WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING
-------------------------
*cloud computing is the delivery of computing services including servers,storage,database,networking,software,security over the cloud to offer faster innovation.

WHY CLOUD COMPUTING
--------------------
*No big setup cost ‚Üí You don‚Äôt need to buy expensive servers.
*Pay as you use ‚Üí Like electricity, you only pay for what you use.
*Access anywhere ‚Üí You can use apps and data from any device with internet.
*Scalable ‚Üí If you need more power or storage, you can get it in minutes.
*Safe & Reliable ‚Üí Cloud companies take care of backups and security.
*Faster ‚Üí You can quickly build and run applications without waiting for hardware.
*üëâ In short: Cloud computing saves money, gives flexibility, and makes work faster and easier.


CLOUD COMPUTING DEPLOYMENT MODELS
-------------------------------------

1 Public Cloud:::
*Services are provided over the internet by cloud companies (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
*Anyone can use it by paying money.
*Example: Gmail, Google Drive, AWS EC2.
‚úÖ Cheap, scalable, no maintenance.
‚ùå Less control.

2 Private Cloud:::
*Cloud is used by only one company.
*Hosted either in their own data center or by a vendor.
*Example: Banks or Government offices using cloud only for them.
‚úÖ More security, more control.
‚ùå Expensive.

3 Hybrid Cloud:::
*A mix of public + private cloud.
*Company keeps sensitive data in private cloud and uses public cloud for normal tasks.
*Example: A hospital stores patient data in private cloud but uses public cloud for running apps.
‚úÖ Balanced cost, flexibility, and security.

üëâ In short:
*Public = Shared & Cheap
*Private = Secure & Expensive
*Hybrid = Mix of Both


DIFFRENT CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE MODELS
------------------------------------------

1 INFRASTRCTURE AS A SERVICE MODEL (IAAS):::

 in this service model application,data,runtime,middleware,o/s,this are all services managed by user.
 then vertualization,servers,storage,networking these are all services managed by vender

2 PLATFORM AS A SERVICE MODEL (PAAS):::

 in this service model only application,and data services managed by user.
 remaining services managed by vendor.

3 SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE MODEL (SAAS):::

 in this service model all services managed a vendor.
becuse this is most effective cloud computing service models in now a days.
